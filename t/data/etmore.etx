-----------

A section from format.txt. The ...text... block triggers Text::EtText's link
detection code incorrectly, which mangles it.  It's actually incorrect markup,
as the ...text... line should not be using normal square brackets without
spaces. Still, the failed link lookup should not mangle the &gt; entity.

The sections are specified using XML-/HTML-style notation, e.g.

	&lt;type attribute=val ...&gt;
	[...text...]
	&lt;/type&gt;

XML-/HTML-style comments (everything between &lt;!-- and --&gt;) are ignored.

-----------

Next one, from ettext.txt.

The href used in the link is then defined at another point in the document, as
an indented line like this:

	&etsqi;<em>label</em>&etsqo;: <em>http://url...</em>

Text and markup can be enclosed in the quotes, everything quoted will become
part of the link text. Single words or HTML tags do not need to be quoted, so
<strong>&lt;img src=''http://jmason.org/license_plate.jpg'' width=''10''
height=''10''&gt; &etsqi;homepage&etsqo;</strong> will work correctly.

Balanced tags: b{test}. span.green{foo}. i.green{green italics}

Another PRE test:

<pre>
	Bar
	[foo]
	Baz
</pre>

Could you see the square brackets?

-----------

Test of lists right beside one another.

	* a list item
	* another
	* and another. This one's a bit longer though... blah blah blah
	foo blah etc blah
		* nest 'em!
		* again
	* and back.

-----------

Title right at top of page
==========================

blah

Smaller title at top of page
----------------------------

blah

----------------------------

That was a HR. so is this:

----------------------------

This is a test of PRE content.

 foo

lovely. How's about this one?

::	<b>this should not be in bold</b>

did that work?

<etleft>Foo</etleft>Bar.

<etright>Foo</etright>Bar.
