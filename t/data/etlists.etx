Checking lists with no start-end tags.

	* list 1

	* l1 i2

	* l1 i3

Next! I prefer this one I think.

	1. foo

	1. bar

	1. baz

How about definition lists?

	Foo:	a random term

	Bar:	yet another

	Baz:	you get the idea.

That's enough of that. What about *with* list tags?

Checking lists with included start-end tags.

<ul>

    * list 1

    * l1 i2

    * l1 i3

</ul>

Next! I prefer this one I think.

<ol>

  1. foo

  1. bar

  1. baz

</ol>

What about indented lists?

    * list 1

    * l1 i2

	* l2 i1

	* l2 i2

    * l1 i3

    * l1 i4

	1. ol2 i1

	1. ol2 i2

    * l1 i5

Tricky indented list -- it has 3 levels, and the innermost falls back
to the outermost. Ouch.

    * l1 i2

	* l2 i1

	* l2 i2

		* l3 i1

		* l3 i2

		* l3 i3

    * l1 i3

That's the lot then. Oh, one more -- end on an EOF.

	* foo

I lied -- there's more.
Lists where the items are right next to one another...
    * foo
    * bar
    * baz
    * glorp

    * with a paragraph break

    * and another.
